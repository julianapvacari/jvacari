# 16. Write a program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation, in the form ax2 + bx + c. THE
# program should ask for the values of a, b and c and make the consistencies, informing the user in the
# following situations:
# The. If the user informs the value of A equal to zero, the equation is not of the second degree and the
# program should not ask for the other values, being terminated;
# B. If the calculated delta is negative, the equation has no real roots. Inform the user and
# close the program;
# รง. If the calculated delta is equal to zero the equation has only one real root; inform it to
# user;
# d. If the delta is positive, the equation has two real roots; inform them to the user;
