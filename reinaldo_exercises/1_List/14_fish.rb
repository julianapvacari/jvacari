#14. Jo達o Papo-de-Pescador, a good man, bought a microcomputer to control the
#daily income from your work. Every time he brings in a weight of fish greater than the
#established by the fishing regulations of the state of S達o Paulo (50 kilos) must pay a fine
#of R$ 4.00 per excess kilo. John needs you to write a program that reads the
#variable weight (fish weight) and calculate the excess. Write in the excess variable the amount of
#kilos beyond the limit and in the fine variable the amount of the fine that Jo達o must pay. print the data
#of the program with the appropriate messages
